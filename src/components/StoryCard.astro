    "It all began on a football field, not a film set. After saving a decisive penalty in school, I was interviewed but forgot to thank my coach and teammates. That moment sparked something — I used the clip to express my gratitude, and its impact made me realize the power of storytelling to connect heart and emotion. That’s when my journey as a content specialist and director truly began.",
